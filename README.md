# Part Two

Status Code Scavenger Hunt!

Use Postman to find each of the following HTTP codes:


1. 200
200 OK

1. 301
move permanently


1. 400
Bad request

1. 401
Unauthorized

1. 403
Forbidden

1. 404
Not Found

1. 418
I'm a teapot

1. 500
Internal Server Error


For each of the questions below, write:

1. The website which generated the HTTP status code


2. A description of what the status code means

200 - Standard response for successful HTTP requests

301 - Standard response for successful HTTP requests

400 - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error

401 - Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.

403 - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action

404 - The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future

418 - April fool's joke

500 - A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable



3. If an app you were writing encountered this status code, what would you do (if anything) to resolve any issues?
In the case of the 301 code, I would send an alert giving the new alert of the link.
